                        Pretrained language models (PLMs) are generating significant impact across a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence domains, including natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and recommendation systems (RecSys). Concurrently, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a structured way of storing knowledge about the real world. These KGs enhance PLMs by infusing external knowledge, which in turn enhances inference and interpretability. However, despite the remarkable progress in PLMs and KGs, current IR systems still exhibit certain weaknesses. Indeed, traditional IR systems, including retrieval and recommendation systems, often encounter challenges in addressing semantic nuances, context relevance, and handling domain-specific intricacies, leading to imprecise results.  To bridge these gaps, we propose the Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval workshop (KEIR @ ECIR 2024) as a platform to discuss innovative approaches that integrate external knowledge, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry to discuss various aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval, including models, techniques, data collection and evaluation.
