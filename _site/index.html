            Pretrained language models (PLMs) are generating significant impact across a wide spectrum of artificial
            intelligence domains, including natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and
            recommendation systems (RecSys). Concurrently, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a structured way of storing
            knowledge about the real world. These KGs enhance PLMs by infusing external knowledge, which in turn
            enhances inference and interpretability. However, despite the remarkable progress in PLMs and KGs, current
            IR systems still exhibit certain weaknesses. Indeed, traditional IR systems, including retrieval and
            recommendation systems, often encounter challenges in addressing semantic nuances, context relevance, and
            handling domain-specific intricacies, leading to imprecise results. To bridge these gaps, we propose the
            Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval workshop (KEIR @ ECIR 2024) as a platform to discuss innovative
            approaches that integrate external knowledge, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval
            in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers
            from academia and industry to discuss various aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval, including
            models, techniques, data collection and evaluation.

    <h4>Large Language Models and Recommender Systems, Opportunities and Challenges</h4>
    <p><b>Abstract</b><br>Recent years have seen great success of large language models (LLMs) in performing many natural language processing tasks, especially tasks that directly serve users such as question answering, text summarization, and text generation in general. At the same time, concerns such as trustworthiness and halluciation have also raised problems about such models in terms of their actual utility when deployed in applications that serve many users. In this talk, I will systematically examine the opportunities and challenges that LLMs have created for recommender systems. Specifically, I will address the following questions, 1) How can LLMs be leveraged to improve the current recommender systems? 2) What is the potental for LLMs to transform the future recommender system applications? 3) What are the major challenges in applying LLMs to recommender systems? 4) Given the anticipated growth of LLMs, what would recommender systems look like in the future?</p>

    <h4><nobr> 10 Challenges in Industiral Recommender Systems </nobr></h4>
    <p><b>Abstract</b><br>Huawei’s vision and mission is to build a fully connected intelligent world. Since 2013, Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab has helped many products to build recommender systems and search engines for getting the right information to the right users. Every day, our recommender systems serve hundreds of millions of mobile phone users and recommend different kinds of content and services such as apps, news feeds, songs, videos, books, themes, and instant services. The big data and various scenarios provide us with great opportunities to develop advanced recommendation technologies. Furthermore, we have witnessed the technical trend of recommendation models in the past ten years, from the shallow and simple models like collaborative filtering, linear model, low rank models to the deep and complex models like neural network, pre-trained language models. Based on the mission, opportunities and technological trends, we have also met several hard problems in our recommender systems. In this talk, we will share ten important and interesting challenges and hope that the RecSys community can get inspired and create better recommender systems.</p>

    <h4>Aligning Large Language Models to Recommendation, Progresses and Future Prospects</h4>
    <p><b>Abstract</b><br>The advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have given rise to a new paradigm in recommendation, known as LLM4Rec. However, due to limitations such as the lack of recommendation related data in the pre-training corpus of LLM, LLMs are not naturally suitable for recommendation. The key to resolving this issue lies in aligning LLMs with recommendations by instruction tuning. Specifically, we will delve into exploring how to unleash the potential of LLMs in the field of the recommendation by focusing on aligning LLMs with both the recommendation task and the recommendation modality. Finally, we shall contemplate the potential concerns posited by LLM4Rec, as well as envision the prospects that LLM4Rec hold.</p>
